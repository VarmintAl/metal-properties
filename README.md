# metal-properties
These two programs calculate the material properties for ductile metals using the Power Law Plasticity (MAT_018) for the LS-DYNA FEA code.
One is for Python and the other is for Fortran 95. The material.txt database is over 1000 raw material properties of metals.

The .BAS files were the original codes written in Microsoft Basic in 2010. Then they were ported over to python and fortran.
